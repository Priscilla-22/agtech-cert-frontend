## Usage

### Backend Usage
```bash
# Example API calls
GET /api/farmers?status=active&county=Kiambu&limit=10
GET /api/farmers?search=john&certificationStatus=pending
GET /api/farmers?minLandSize=5&maxLandSize=20&farmingType=organic
```

### Frontend Usage
The filter component is automatically integrated into the farmers page. Users can:

1. Click the "Filters" button to open the filter panel
2. Set desired filter criteria
3. Click "Apply Filters" to fetch filtered results
4. View active filters in the summary badges
5. Clear all filters with the "Clear" button

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `date-fns` - For date formatting and manipulation (already existed)
- Various Radix UI components for form controls and overlays

### Performance Considerations
- **Debounced API calls** - Manual filter application prevents excessive API calls
- **Pagination support** - Handles large datasets efficiently
- **Index optimization** - Backend queries are optimized for common filter combinations
- **Mobile-first design** - Optimized for mobile performance

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard navigation** - Full keyboard support for all filter controls
- **Screen reader support** - Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **High contrast support** - Compatible with high contrast themes
- **Focus management** - Proper focus management in modal/popover interfaces

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

2. **Filter presets** - Pre-defined filter combinations for common use cases
3. **Advanced search** - More sophisticated search with multiple field combinations
4. **Export filtered data** - Export functionality for filtered results
5. **Real-time updates** - WebSocket support for real-time data updates
6. **Bulk operations** - Bulk actions on filtered results
7. **Filter analytics** - Track most commonly used filters for UX improvements

## Testing

The filter functionality should be tested with:

1. **Various filter combinations** - Test multiple filters together
2. **Edge cases** - Empty results, invalid date ranges, etc.
3. **Mobile devices** - Test on actual mobile devices and tablets
4. **Performance** - Test with large datasets
5. **Accessibility** - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
6. **Browser compatibility** - Test across different browsers
7. **API error handling** - Test backend failures and error scenarios

## Deployment Notes

When deploying this feature:

1. Ensure backend database has proper indexes on filtered columns
2. Monitor API performance with the new query complexity
3. Test mobile responsiveness on actual devices
4. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
5. Update API documentation with new filter parameters
6. Consider rate limiting for the farmers API endpoint
